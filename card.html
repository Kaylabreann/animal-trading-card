			<p> Neither Mantis nor Shrimp - the Mantis Shrimp is one of the oldest species on Earth.
				There are approximately 450 Mantis Shrimp species covered in vibrant colors. Their punches
				move about the same velocity of a .22 caliber rifle. These punches can generate temperatures as hot as 
				the sun in surrounding water in a split second.
